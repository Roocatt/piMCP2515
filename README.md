# piMCP2515

A library for interacting with the MCP2515 CAN bus controller via SPI.

This is a very early work in progress which is not in any way
complete or tested. It is not usable in any way. I am working
on it though, and I hope to have this complete soon.

## Goals

- [ ] Finish building and testing the code
- [ ] Support for the Pi Pico
- [ ] Support for regular Pi devices (after the Pico)
