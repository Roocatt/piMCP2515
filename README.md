# piMCP2515

A library for interacting with CAN bus via SPI and an MCP2515.

This is a very early work in progress. It is incomplete and not
tested. I am working on it though, and I hope to have this complete
soon.

## Goals

- [ ] Finish building and testing the code
- [ ] Support for the Pi Pico
- [ ] Support for regular Pi devices (after the Pico)
