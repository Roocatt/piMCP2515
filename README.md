# piMCP2515

A library for interacting with the MCP2515 CAN bus controller via SPI.

This is a very early work in progress which is not in any way complete
or tested. It is not usable in any way. I am working on it though, and
I hope to have this complete soon.

In addition to the 'Goals' section detailing larger scale targets for
this project, there are numerous `TODO` comments outlining things that
need doing. These will make varying degrees of sense to anyone else
reading the code as many are intended slightly more as personal notes.

## Goals

- [ ] Finish building and testing the initial code
- [ ] Support for the Pi Pico
- [ ] Support for regular Raspberry Pi devices
  - [ ] With Linux
  - [ ] With BSD
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Easy cross-compiling
